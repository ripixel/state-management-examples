Examples of various state management techniques in React

## What examples are there?

It covers the possible usage of the following methods for managing state in a React application:

- Ref
- Context
- State
- Flux (a la React release version)
- Redux
- Recoil
- MobX

It attempts to address the pros/cons of each, and what they should and should not be used for.

## How to use the sample code

The sample application uses a very basic React Router to decide which implementation you want to see.

In `src/pages` you can see the various examples, as well as in the index.

In `src/components` you will find the various components that are referenced in each of the pages.

## Tests?

Nope! These are examples, not production code!

## Is it live?

Yes! It's on my personal website: [https://state-management-examples.ripixel.co.uk](https://state-management-examples.ripixel.co.uk)

## Running locally

Run `npm ci` to install dependencies, then `npm run dev` to boot up a local server.
